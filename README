# DESCRIPTION
===============

Battery indicator for keyboard. At first, I only want make this extension for my Keychron K2,
but it should work with any keyboard in general as long as you can find it when running upower -d

# INSTALLATION

The other way: install from git
   1. From your terminal, go to "~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions"
   2. Clone the source code from git:
	git clone https://github.com/cobblestone88/kBoardBattery-brightstone8x.gmail.com.git
   3. Restart gnome-shell: Alt + F2, type 'r' then hit Enter

# KNOWN ISSUE
===============

   1. Refresh time is 2 minutes by default (of DBusProxy) not yet figure out how to change it for now. 
   2. Connect keyboard after the extenstion is enable (or after login) - FIXED IN VER 2
    -> it will never show the %
    -> work arownd: disable then enable the extension again then it should work
   3. Only show battery for 1 keyboard, if you connect more than one then it will show the first keyb found.

# TROUBLESHOOTING
===================

This extension retrieve device's info using DBusProxy & GlibUPower, if you ever notice any issue with the extension:
   1. First, check if UPower can see your device, this extension can only see you device if UPower does
      method 1: Issue 'upower -d | grep keyboard -A 7' in your terminnal
      method 2: Run gnome-power-statistics
   2. Check gnome-shell log:
      journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep kBatt		# this commmand will dump all gnome-shell log ever record
      journalctl -f /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep kBatt		# this will only show new log

# TIPS FOR THOSE WHO'S USING KEYCHRON KEYBOARDS WITH LINUX 
===========================================================
(you don't to install the extention above for tips bellow)

Here the best setup (I think so :D) for Keychron + Linux
	Step 1: Set fkeyfirst by:
	- Create the file /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf. Add this line to the file: "options hid_apple fnmode=2"
	- Save the file and execute the following command: "sudo update-initramfs -u"
	- Reboot
	Step 2: Use the keyboard in Windows/Android mode
	Step 3: If get stuck with numpad mode: Double hit F6 or fn + F6.
	I've been using this config since the very first day, both bluetooth and cable with no problem.

Alternative config:
	For step 1: you can just do "echo 2 | tee sudo /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode" instead.
	But the setting will be reset after reboot, so the method above is to make sure that the setting 
	is permanent after reboot. Also someone recommends to create a udev rule for keychron devices
	
Enable bluetooth fastconnect config:
	1. Edit the file /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
	2. Uncomment FastConnectable config and set it to true: FastConnectable = true
	3. Uncomment ReconnectAttempts=3 (set the value to whatever number that you want)
	4. Uncomment ReconnectIntervals=3
