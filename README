Battery indicator for keyboard. At first, I only want make this extention for my Keychron K2,
but it should work with any keyboard in general as long as you can find it when running upower -d

To install this extention from git
   1. From your terminal, go to "~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions"
   2. Clone the source code from git:
	git clone https://github.com/cobblestone88/kBoardBattery-brightstone8x.gmail.com.git
